# UniGUI-Based Binary Decoder

This repository contains a binary decoder project developed with **Delphi UniGUI**.

The project was created as an experimental and educational exercise,
focusing on binary logic, decoding processes, and basic interface interaction
within the UniGUI framework.

This is not a production-ready application.
It represents an early-stage exploration and a snapshot of how I approached
problem-solving and UI logic at the time.

The project is published as part of my personal archive and learning journey.

## Notes

- Built using Delphi and UniGUI
- Focused on binary-to-decimal decoding logic
- Developed as a standalone learning project
